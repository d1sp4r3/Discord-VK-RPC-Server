<b>Hello!</b>

This is part of my project to create Discord RPC for VK Music. 
I've only recently started learning TypeScript and JavaScript in general, so yes, the project works, but there are obvious flaws. 
If you'd like, you can fix them via a fork. 
However, I'm no longer maintaining this project, so you'll have to fix any bugs and issues yourselves =)
